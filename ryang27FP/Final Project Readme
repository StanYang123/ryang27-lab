1. Project Overview:
-Briefly describe the project in your own words.
My project is a lightweight Java web project based on JavaTa EE using JSF for page construction
-How do you meet each part of the specification requirements?
Write code using the corresponding Java class package as required, such as adding or deleting entity classes; Used the JPA persistence layer framework for database operations


2. Design:
-Describe the design of your project's functionality.
The project is divided into two main modules: user login and registration, entity class management (adding, deleting, modifying, and querying)
Design selection: Java language, Jpa, Jsf, JavaTa EE. The overall design adopts a three-layer architecture
-What functions have you implemented?
User login registration, entity class management (add, delete, modify, query)
-How is the navigation process between functional areas?
Bind the JSF page with the corresponding controller class to perform page to page transitions
-In addition, use this section to list any additional features you have implemented and how to incorporate them into your design, including your insights.


3. Requirements (installation, compilation, running, database, etc.):
-Explain how I should install, build, and run your project.
Use the corresponding MySQL 8.0 database to execute the corresponding SQL file, configure the corresponding Maven dependency package management, and add the corresponding dependency package to the project
-The detailed steps are as if I have no knowledge of how to perform these operations.
(1) Use the corresponding idea tool to import the project and configure Maven dependency package management
(2) Download MySQL 8.0 database and SQLYOG database management tool
(3) Use sqlyog to execute the corresponding SQL file
-What are the versions of tools, libraries, and APIs used in your project?
MySQL 8.0, lombok, jakarta. jakartaee api10.0


4. Screenshot:
-Include sufficient screenshots to illustrate the performance of your project.


5. Expected results/known issues:
-Use this section to describe any known issues in the project. Nothing is perfect, recording problems is better than ignoring them.
-Please also provide a known and working test script for me to follow when running your project.
Account: user Password: 123


6. Development insights:
-Use this section to tell me anything about the project and your design/development experience during the project.
-What have you learned?
I have learned how to quickly develop a Java Web project, consider the overall project structure, security, performance, and more
-What is there that you would like to further explore?
I hope to strengthen my understanding of the underlying use of libraries and tools, so that I can have a clear understanding of the project. It is more convenient to complete a Java web using mainstream frameworks in the industry

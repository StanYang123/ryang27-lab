Your Name Lab 2 README

Question 1:

I used the first real column database, used the event table, and selected the name, date, type, and remark fields.

Question 2:

I chose MySQL 8.0 and Junit5 because I am more familiar with using them

Question 3:

Maven automatically builds code packages, and command line Java is also a way to compile code packages.

Use the Java command to package the code package into a jar package. Java cp name.java Java - jar name.jar.

Maven is a project management tool that abstracts project development and management processes into a Project Object Model (POM). Developers only need to make some simple configurations to batch complete project construction, report generation, and document generation.
